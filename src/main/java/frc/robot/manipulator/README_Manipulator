This is a text file describing the manipulator commands and subsytems.

The Subsystem File will initialize and define all of the motors used for the manipulator.

There are multiple files found within this folder, each named ''action'.java'

These files contain a command which is run on the now-defined motors, and if a debug is toggled, they will print their actions as they do so.

The command file maps these actions to a controller, so that when a button is pressed, an action is performed.
